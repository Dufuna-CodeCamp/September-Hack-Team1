            The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a communicable
            respiratory disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that
            causes illness in humans. Scientists are still learning about the
            disease, and think that the virus began in animals. At some point,
            one or more humans acquired infection from an animal, and those
            infected humans began transmitting infection to other humans. The
            disease spreads from person to person through infected air droplets
            that are projected during sneezing or coughing. It can also be
            transmitted when humans have contact with hands or surfaces that
            contain the virus and touch their eyes, nose, or mouth with the
            contaminated hands. COVID-19 was first reported in China, but it has
            now spread throughout the world.

            Countries around the world are implementing measures to slow the
            spread of the coronavirus, from national quarantines to school
            closures. While "lockdown" isn't a technical term used by
            public-health officials, it can refer to anything from mandatory
            geographic quarantines to non-mandatory recommendations to stay at
            home, closures of certain types of businesses, or bans on events and
            gatherings, Lindsay Wiley, a health law professor at the Washington
            College of Law, told Vox. Here are the countries and territories
            that have implemented mandatory mass quarantines so far — and how
            some of them are beginning to open up.

            When the COVID-19 pandemic first struck, infectious disease experts
            took up the same refrain they do every flu season about preventing
            the spread of a viral infection — wash your hands, don’t touch your
            face, keep your distance, and cover your mouth and nose when you
            sneeze or cough. While these are excellent recommendations at all
            times, we’ve gained a new understanding of their importance during
            this health care crisis. To minimize your exposure to harmful viral
            agents in this way, your best line of defense is handwashing.
            Washing your hands every time you touch something may be
            impractical, so here are the CDC recommendations for when to wash
            your hands...

            In countries around the globe, PATH is partnering with governments
            to support the COVID-19 response. These efforts take different forms
            depending on local needs, local PATH expertise, and the support of
            our donors. In Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda, we received urgent requests
            to partner with the national ministries of health to secure personal
            protective equipment (PPE) for frontline health workers—masks,
            gloves, goggles, aprons, soap, and other supplies. Working with our
            longtime donor The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, we were able to fund
            the rapid local procurement and global delivery of PPE to ministry
            officials.
